# Service Workers in JavaScript

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Service Workers in JavaScript to enhance web applications. Service Workers act as a proxy between the web application and the network, allowing for features such as offline capabilities, background sync, and push notifications.

## What are Service Workers?

Service Workers are scripts that run in the background of a web application, separate from the main browser thread. They enable developers to intercept network requests, cache resources, and manage push notifications, providing a more reliable and engaging user experience.

## Key Features

- **Offline Support**: Cache resources to allow the application to function without an internet connection.
- **Background Sync**: Synchronize data in the background when the user is back online.
- **Push Notifications**: Send notifications to users even when the application is not open.

## Getting Started

To get started with Service Workers in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Set up a basic web application**: Ensure you have a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript setup.
2. **Register the Service Worker**: Add the following code to your main JavaScript file:

   ```javascript
   if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
     window.addEventListener("load", () => {
       navigator.serviceWorker
         .register("/service-worker.js")
         .then((registration) => {
           console.log(
             "Service Worker registered with scope:",
             registration.scope
           );
         })
         .catch((error) => {
           console.error("Service Worker registration failed:", error);
         });
     });
   }
   ```

3. **Create the Service Worker file**: Create a file named `service-worker.js` in the root of your project.

## Usage

In your `service-worker.js`, you can implement caching strategies and handle fetch events. Here's a simple example:

```javascript
self.addEventListener("install", (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open("v1").then((cache) => {
      return cache.addAll(["/", "/index.html", "/styles.css", "/script.js"]);
    })
  );
});

self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then((response) => {
      return response || fetch(event.request);
    })
  );
});
```
